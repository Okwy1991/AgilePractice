Theoretical concepts and formulas: Data analytics lectures often involve a lot of theoretical concepts and formulas that can be dry and difficult to follow for some students.

Repetitive examples: Lecturers may use the same examples and case studies to explain different concepts, leading to a sense of boredom and monotony for students.

Lack of real-world applications: Some data analytics lectures may focus too much on theory and not enough on practical, real-world applications of the concepts being taught. This can make the material seem disconnected from the students' everyday experiences.

Lengthy lectures: Data analytics lectures can sometimes be long and dense, making it challenging for students to stay engaged and focused throughout the entire session.

Lack of hands-on practice: Some data analytics lectures may not provide enough opportunities for students to practice applying the concepts they have learned, which can make the material less engaging and meaningful.
